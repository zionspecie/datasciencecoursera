## Summary Calculations

For each combination of `subject` and `activity`, the following was calculated:
- The **average (mean)** of each mean and standard deviation measurement.

## Units

- All features are derived from smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope signals.

##Variable Interpretations

- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX`: Average of the time-domain signal from the body accelerometer along the X-axis.
- `FrequencyBodyGyroscopeSTDZ`: Standard deviation of the frequency-domain signal from the gyroscope along the Z-axis.

## Notes

- Only measurements with `mean()` or `std()` in their original names were included.
- Variable names were cleaned to make them more human-readable and consistent with tidy data principles.
